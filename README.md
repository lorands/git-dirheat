# Git Dir Heat  

Create a heat-map of Git changes over time. 

# Usage

Just point the application to a Git repository and watch the magic happen.

```shell
git-dirheat /path/to/repo
```

Afterwards, you can view the heat-map in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`. Or get the json data exposed at `http://localhost:8080/data`.
